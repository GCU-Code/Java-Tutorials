# Creating a Simple Print Method

I dislike always having to type <mark>System.out.println("...");</mark> when wanting to send a message to the console, 
so an ultra easy way is to simply create a class and a method to handle it for you. Additionally, you are able to access it accross your project.
Keeps things looking nice and simple, and maybe less daunting?
